Our main focus goes on creating the stacked matrices as differently as possible so that it captures the maximum dynamics possible of the considered signal.

## Abstract 
Power systems are prone to failures such as power quality tripping, resonance, and CMV failures. These failures are
infinite and dynamic because of the fluctuations in the power system impedance together with its load demand and harmonic distortions. To have stability and control over the power system together with a quality power supply, it is imperative to monitor the
fundamental frequency. Motivated by this, a data-driven approach based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is proposed
which is essential to observe parameters such as frequency and amplitude. This methodology works well for extracting fundamental frequency under harmonics, sub-harmonics, and inter-harmonics scenarios in the signal which causes considerable damage to
end-user equipment if not monitored properly. In this methodology, appended time-shifted power signals stacked into a measurement matrix are used for extracting the parameters from the signal. DMD relies on dynamics to capture information and predict
frequencies. Measurement matrices play a crucial role in identifying the underlying dynamics of the system. Thus it creates a
suitable measurement matrix and gives us input to the data-driven system which is vital for the system to perform well. This study
investigates the importance of different special matrices such as Hankel, Toeplitz, and Circulant to create the measurement matrices
in DMD to extract the signal parameters. DMD can replace conventional Fourier-based techniques by reducing the estimation error
percentage. Various experiments are conducted to confirm the potentiality of the proposed methodology.
